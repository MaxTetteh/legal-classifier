This is an end-to-end Legal Agreements classifcation application. You could run the app locally by downloading the source code or clonining it for your IDE. 
I also deloyed the app on PythonAnywhere, however the platform has a limit of 100s CPU free-compute time which is much lower for an application with marginally intense compute requirements.

Check out the application here: https://maxtetteh.pythonanywhere.com/

Also comes with OCR enabled functionality to extract text from scanned legal agreeements.

Clone with ' git clone ' and then in your terminal, run the command below
Download dependencies with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
Use 'python app.py' to compile locally on your preferred Code Editor.
This should spin up the localhost in your browser to view the web-app
