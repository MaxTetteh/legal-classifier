This is an end-to-end Legal Agreements classifcation application. You could run the app locally by downloading the source code or clonining it for your IDE. 
I also deloyed the app on PythonAnywhere, however the platform has a limit of 100s CPU free-compute time which is much lower for an application with marginally intense compute requirements.

Check out the application here: https://maxtetteh.pythonanywhere.com/

Also comes with OCR enabled functionality to extract text from scanned legal agreeements.

Clone with ' git clone ' and then in your terminal, run the command below
Download dependencies with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
Use 'python app.py' to compile locally on your preferred Code Editor.
This should spin up the localhost in your browser to view the web-app

Building-model-final.ipynb and Buiding-model-testing.ipynb are the core python files used in model training and testing. You can run them by uploading the files onto Google Colab or with the links https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xleWRst3siuEt1oe5kPldbmfDumTmk3u?usp=sharing and https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FExYnpZ5KTI_2hepy0bdgSmXO7ThfW-I?usp=sharing
